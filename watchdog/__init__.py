"""api-watchdog — keep unattended Claude Code sessions moving. Five jobs per poll:

  (1) AUTO-RESUME: a session STALLED ON AN API ERROR (529 / ConnectionRefused /
      rate limit) is resumed with `tmux send-keys "continue"` + a Discord ping.
  (2) NOTIFY-ONLY: a session WAITING ON THE USER (an AskUserQuestion / permission
      dialog is open) is PINGED — never acted on, a design decision needs the
      human. This closes the gap that left a blocked `bakerion` session silent:
      an AskUserQuestion wait is neither a `❓` Stop-marker turn nor `idle_prompt`,
      so no hook covered it.
  (3) WEEKLY-LIMIT ALERT: the 3rd reason work stalls — the WEEKLY subscription
      token limit runs out. A rate-limited poll of Anthropic's oauth/usage window
      state (the same data `/usage` shows) pings ONCE per reset window when a
      weekly limit reaches the cap percent (default 98), so the user can react before it
      hard-stops. Polled at most every USAGE_INTERVAL — the endpoint 429s hard.
  (4) WORKING-STALL ALERT (PING ONLY): the 4th reason work stalls — a session ended
      `⏳ WORKING` (a background process / Monitor / build is running, it'll report
      when done) but then NOTHING happened for STALL_WORKING and NO subagent is
      advancing. A crashed / OOM-killed / hung job emits no completion event, so a
      success-only wait hangs FOREVER (the bug that lost the user 8 hours on a dead
      `verdict` process). The watchdog PINGS once ("this session may be stuck on dead
      launched work — check it"). It NEVER injects keys: an adversarial review proved
      idle-after-`⏳` is ALSO the signature of HEALTHY waiting (a live CI / mutation /
      encode wait freezes the parent transcript for 15-25 min routinely), so the
      poller CANNOT prove a stall from outside and must not type into a possibly-
      healthy pane (the user's scar). The real fix — poll your own launched work for
      liveness from INSIDE the session — is the rule verify-launched-work-liveness.md;
      job 4 is only a safe backstop. Gated by an advancing-subagent check (skips the
      common healthy long wait) + a high threshold (skips CI/mutation) + once-per-
      episode dedup, so the ping is rare and true.
  (5) DELIVER A PENDING ✅ (the unreliable-idle_prompt backstop): notify-discord-
      pending.sh records a `✅ DONE` to /tmp/claude-discord-pending-<sid>; notify-
      discord.sh delivers it on `idle_prompt` — but CC emits idle_prompt UNRELIABLY
      over tmux/SSH, so on dev2 a finished turn's ✅ ping silently never arrives (the
      pending just sits in /tmp — the reported symptom). The watchdog delivers it
      once the session has been idle >= PENDING_DONE_GRACE, but ONLY while its
      CURRENT last marker is STILL ✅ — a session that re-fired (a background task
      re-invoked it → now ⏳) has its stale ✅ cleared WITHOUT pinging, so the device
      is never told "done" for work that kept going. PING ONLY; claim-then-send.

WHY A POLLER, NOT A HOOK
------------------------
When a turn dies on an API error (529 overloaded, ConnectionRefused, rate/usage
limit) Claude Code ABORTS the turn — it does NOT reliably fire the `Stop` hook
with the error as `last_assistant_message`. So the `notify-api-error.sh` Stop
hook is blind to exactly the event it was meant to catch (the user saw 529s in 3
projects and got no ping). A timer that reads each `claude` pane's transcript +
screen catches the stall reliably. This is the community pattern (amux,
claude-auto-retry): watch the tmux panes, steer a resume message in.

DETECTION (per `claude` tmux pane)
----------------------------------
- Map the pane's cwd → its newest transcript under ~/.claude/projects/<enc>/.
- ERROR signal: the session's last assistant entry is flagged `isApiErrorMessage`
  (Claude Code's own definitive marker). This is the ONLY trigger — it is set only
  on an error CC actually hit, never on a user/agent merely quoting "API Error" in
  prose. (An earlier pane-text fallback was removed: it matched any session
  DISPLAYING api-error text and false-nudged an active meta-conversation.)
- STALL TIMER (state, NOT transcript mtime): from the first poll where the last
  reply is an api-error, `decide` counts how long it has stayed that way and nudges
  after GRACE. It does NOT gate on transcript-idle — Claude Code's own retries +
  queue/snapshot writes keep touching the transcript, so an mtime-idle gate never
  reaches GRACE for a rate-limited session (the bug that left `presenter`
  unnudged). first_seen is seeded with `now - idle` so an already-stale stall
  counts from when it really began; a session that recovers (last reply turns
  normal) is dropped from state, giving Claude Code its own GRACE to recover first.

SAFETY GATES (never steer keys into the wrong / busy pane)
---------------------------------------------------------
- AMBIGUOUS BINDING: panes are grouped by their resolved transcript; if two panes
  own one transcript (two `claude` terminals in one cwd, or two cwds colliding
  under CC's '/'/'.'/'_'→'-' dir encoding) we SKIP — never guess which pane to
  poke. A missed auto-resume beats a `continue` typed into a healthy pane.
- COPY-MODE: a pane in copy-mode / a modal (user scrolling) is skipped this cycle
  WITHOUT burning a retry — keys would be swallowed or corrupt the user's selection.

ACTION (state machine, see `decide`)
------------------------------------
first sighting -> 'wait' (record first_seen); 'nudge' #1 right away IF already
                 >=GRACE stuck (seeded from now-idle), else after GRACE (+ ONE ping)
+INTERVAL each      -> 'nudge' #2, #3
after MAX_NUDGES     -> 'escalate' (ping "gave up", stop — no continue-spam during
                        a long Anthropic outage)
USAGE/QUOTA cap      -> ping ONCE, NO `continue` (time-based; only the reset clock
                        fixes it — CC auto-resumes when the cap resets)
recovered            -> key dropped from state (a future error starts fresh)

A session waiting on a real `❓` is NEVER auto-continued: its last assistant entry
is the question (not `isApiErrorMessage`), so the error signal is false.

This module is PURE logic + thin tmux shims. The I/O (`run` = tmux exec, `send_fn`
= Discord send) is injectable so the state machine is unit-tested with no tmux and
no network.
