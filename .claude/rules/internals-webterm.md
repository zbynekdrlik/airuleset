### airuleset internals — webterm dashboard + tmux client sizing

The webterm sizing area has been reopened many times (#584/#586/#613×3/#615/#648/#661/#672).
Non-obvious, hard-won invariants (deep detail lives in the code comments of the named symbols,
which auto-load when you read `cli_webterm.py`):

- **A too-small tmux CLIENT is CROPPED, never scaled (#672).** A client attached `-f ignore-size`
  that is SMALLER than the window gets a cursor-following CROP of the window — everything below
  the cursor (the CC statusline footer + agent strip) is clipped. `capture-pane` shows the footer
  IS in the pane; only the client's render clips it. This is the whole #672 bug.
- **A webterm crop fix is BROWSER-GRID-bound, NOT tmux-side (#672).** `-f ignore-size` is REQUIRED
  to keep the target's OWN client un-resized (removing it lets the owner's client resize the
  window = degradation; proven by a control). With ignore-size, the client viewport == its ttyd
  pty == the browser xterm grid (`fitFixedGrid` clamps `term.resize`). So the ONLY non-degrading
  way to stop the crop is to make the browser grid ≥ the target window. No `window-size` mode
  helps (smallest degrades the owner; largest/latest keep their size and the small client still
  crops). Do NOT chase a tmux-side fix — the geometry forbids it.
- **Owner box vs foreign-stream box grid (#672).** An OWNER box pins `window-size manual` +
  `default-size 176x50` (cli_tmux_provisioning), so the owner grid `_webterm_term_grid()` = 176x51
  matches the window → no crop, no dark border. A FOREIGN-STREAM box does NOT pin — its window
  follows the stream dev's own client (David 305x57). So foreign-stream tabs get their own larger
  `WEBTERM_STREAM_TERM_GRID` (per-tab `tcols`/`trows` in `_tab_sessions`, kind=="stream" only);
  owner tabs keep 176x51 or a dark border returns. A grid too LARGE for a small-terminal stream is
  a harmless dark border (everything visible), a grid too SMALL crops — prefer generous.
- **Keep the churned `fitFixedGrid`/`fillFixedGrid` FILL region UNTOUCHED (#672).** Per-tab grid is
  delivered via a getter over `CFG.term_cols`/`CFG.term_rows` placed right after `const CFG` (an
  uncontended spot), so the fill algorithm reads them unchanged.
- **A `current`-keyed getter + the resize-CLAMP is a RACE trap (#672).** `fitFixedGrid`'s clamp
  (`term.resize = () => real(...)`) captured the grid at INSTALL time, and a preloaded tab's ttyd
  can connect LATE while `current` has moved to a different-grid tab → a STICKY clamp to the wrong
  grid that silently re-crops. FIX: the clamp reads `CFG.term_cols`/`CFG.term_rows` LIVE on every
  resize (activate() shows only the current tab, so a clamped resize of a visible terminal always
  sees its own grid). Any future per-tab-grid work must keep this live-read property.
- **Prod owner-dashboard render path is `human="zbynek"`, not `human=None`** — `entries_for_tab_list`
  + `preserve_order=True`, which preserves `kind`. Lock BOTH paths in a test (the crop regression
  test renders `human=None`; add a `human="zbynek"` case too).
- **Empirical proof method (#672, mirrors #613 ctrlbw harness).** Reproduce a sizing/crop bug on an
  ISOLATED tmux server: reuse `_IsolatedTmuxServer` (own `-S` socket, `TMUX`/`TMUX_PANE` stripped,
  `pty.openpty()`+`TIOCSWINSZ` pinned pty clients, wall-clock `_drain`). Attach one normal client +
  one `-f ignore-size` smaller client; assert the footer marker is absent from the small client's
  RENDERED screen (crop) and present at the fixed grid. ALWAYS include a no-degradation CONTROL
  (the window size must be unchanged after the ignore-size attach). NEVER touch a live session.
