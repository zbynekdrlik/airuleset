# Hook: Stop — records a PENDING Discord notification for the idle sender.
#
# Mobile-app notification model (paired with notify-discord.sh on the idle event):
# the device is pinged ONLY when Claude genuinely ASKS the user (❓ NEEDS YOU) or
# FULLY completed work (✅ DONE) — never on ⏳ WORKING, never on routine progress.
#
# This hook runs on EVERY turn (it has last_assistant_message). It does NOT send
# anything itself — it only writes the would-send payload to a per-session pending
# file when the turn ends with ❓ / ✅, and CLEARS that file on ⏳ / no-marker.
# notify-discord.sh sends the pending payload ONLY when the user is idle/away.
#
# Marker detection scans the WHOLE message (not just the last line): a completion
# report puts `## ✅ Work Complete` at the TOP and ends with a PR/URL or a
# `❓ Question:` line, so last-line-only detection would miss the most important
# "done" event. Precedence: an ACTIVE question (❓ on the last non-blank line) wins
# over a ✅ heading elsewhere (a report can have both — the trailing ❓ means it is
# waiting on the user).
#
# Silent + non-blocking: writes NOTHING to stdout and always exit 0, so it never
# interferes with the Stop decision pipeline (the other stop-check-*.sh gates).
